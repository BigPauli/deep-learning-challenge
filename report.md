### Overview
The objective of this analysis was to create a neural network model that would be able to accurately predict the most likely outcome of a potential loan.

The provided information from each historical loan included EIN, name, application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization, income amount, special considerations, status, and whether or not the loan was successful. As previously stated, the target is whether or not the loan was successful. Every other column would be considered a feature. For my purposes, I removed the name, EIN, special considerations, and status columns. Name and EIN were removed since they have no bearing on the success of a loan. I personally believe that special considerations should not be included because it could lean either way. A special consideration could make the loan less likely to be successful or more likely, with no real way of discerning, so it would likely just confuse the model. I also found the status column to be unhelpful, since an incomplete loan could never be successful, so that information is unhelpful. Finally, I converted the income amount column to be numerical, since I thought it would have more significance for the model to actually see a number rather than a categorical column.

### Model Parameters
For my model, I used hyperparameters for optimization. I chose to have between 2 and 4 hidden layers. I believe that 3 should be the minimum number of hidden layers for complex relationships such as these. For the input layer, I chose for there to be between 1 and 256 perceptrons with steps of 32. I wanted there to be a large variety of sizes without that process taking too long to run. Picking 256 perceptrons specifically was mostly arbitrary. For the hidden layers, I went with between 1 and 128 perceptrons. Again, this is mostly arbitrary, but I wanted the hidden layers to have much fewer perceptrons than the input layer. For my activation functions, I went with either relu or tanh, as I found those to have the best performance

### Model Performance
Unfortunately, I was unable to reach the desired 75% accuracy, achieving a maximum accuracy of 74.35%. I personally believe that more feature engineering would have helped the model perform better, but I do not know enough about loans to be able to do this efficiently.

The optimizations that I tried, and may not have kept, were converting the income amount into a numerical column, removing special considerations, removing rows where status was incomplete and then dropping the status column, reducing the number of different classifications, and changing the number of hidden layers and perceptrons multiple times.

I personally believe that deep learning would be the preferred method for this application, but I lack the relevant field knowledge to be able to properly set up the data for feeding to the model. This is because it deep learning is the best at finding these complex relationships and has the most flexibility. As it stands currently, I would not use this model as a way to confidently predict the outcome of loans. While it could be used to get a good general idea, 74% is not at all trustworthy.
